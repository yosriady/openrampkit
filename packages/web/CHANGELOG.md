## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a88cec: **Breaking.** The modal shows `step.detail` and the legs of `session.payment` (with the delivery transaction of each leg). The i18n key `stepSub` is `stepDetail`. The quote row says "Fees included in the rate" for a fee whose amount the provider does not give, and never "No fees" for such a quote. New keys `feesInRate` and `feeInRate` in all six catalogs.

- 51167ad: **Breaking.** `onEvent` gets a typed `ClientEvent`. The modal offers "Try again" only when the session status is `requires_payment_method` (a failed attempt), not after a final failure. New `CANCELED` result titles in every locale. The `CLOSED` error code is in the closed `OpenRampErrorCode` union. The other renames of the 0.1 data model apply.

  See the [0.1 data model record](https://github.com/yosriady/openrampkit/blob/main/docs/design/data-model-0.1.md).

- 321b02a: The modal no longer follows the browser language. It is in English unless the app sets `locale` (on the modal or on the session).
- 77f762d: First release on npm. All `@openrampkit/*` packages have the same version (0.1.0). The Release workflow publishes them from GitHub Actions with npm provenance. Read [Releases and versions](https://github.com/yosriady/openrampkit/blob/main/docs/guide/releases.md) for the 0.x stability rules.
- 230c5ad: First MVP release: deposit and withdraw modal, self-hosted server, pathway planner, and 12 provider adapters.
- 8d66ab9: Locked withdraw targets and pay link revocation.

  - Server: `CreateSessionInput` has `target` and `lockDestination` for withdraw sessions. The server checks the target at creation (format, `allowedDestinations`, `screenAddress`) and stores it as the destination. With `lockDestination: true`, `POST /sessions/:id/target` answers `409 DESTINATION_LOCKED`, for the client secret and for a pay link. A cash target (`{ type: 'fiat', currency }`) can also be locked.
  - Server: pay links have an `id`. `openramp.sessions.revokePayLink(sessionId, linkId)` and `POST /sessions/:id/pay-link/revoke` make one link stop working. The credential format is now `{sessionId}.pay_{exp}_{linkId}_{sig}`.
  - Core: `PublicSession.destinationLocked` and the error code `DESTINATION_LOCKED`.
  - Client and web: with a locked target, the withdraw flow skips the target screen and the tabs, gets the plan with `/plan`, and shows the locked address read only.
  - MCP: a bound payout creates the session with the target set and locked, and then plans, quotes and starts it (no `/target` call). The operations from `createRampOps` have `revokePayLink(sessionId)`.

- 8a2ec99: Compare routes in demos: the mock adapter gets `id`, `feeBps`, `spreadBps`, `eta`, `methods`, `countries`, `cardCheckout: 'form'` (test card fields in the widget) and `exchange` (the new `exchange_transfer` method). Several mock instances can now run side by side. Core adds the `exchange_transfer` method ("From an exchange", a deposit address like `transfer`) and `isAddressTransfer()`. The widget treats it like `transfer` and names exchanges as examples. Selects in the widget have one chevron, centred, in every browser. The server reads request bodies in browsers without `Request.body` (Firefox).
- f4a89d0: Security: `POST /sessions/:id/quotes` now returns `PublicQuote[]`. Each leg has no adapter `data`, so provider URLs (for example the Coinbase onramp URL), request bodies and idempotency nonces stay on the server. New types: `PublicQuote` and `PublicLegQuote` in `@openrampkit/core`. The client, the web element and the MCP server use them. `@openrampkit/client` and `@openrampkit/web` re-export `PublicQuote` and `PublicLegQuote` in place of `Quote`. `rankQuotes` is generic. The server keeps the full `Quote` in its store for `start()`.
- 5997e23: Refunds and chargebacks after success. A provider event `refunded` for a leg that succeeded, or the new leg status `reversed` (a chargeback or a returned payout), no longer gets lost. The server keeps the leg with its new status, adds it to the timeline, sets the new step state `REVERSED` (error `PAYMENT_REVERSED`) and the new session status `reversed`, and sends the new `session.reversed` webhook once, with a deterministic event id (and `withdrawal.reversed` for a withdrawal). The event data has `index`, `adapterId`, `legId`, `legStatus` and `previous`. Take back or freeze the credit when you get it. A `REVERSED` session refuses `restart`, and a completed or reversed session refuses a new `select`.

  Core: new `StateName` `REVERSED` (`COMPLETED` can move to it), `LegStatus` `reversed`, `SessionStatus` `reversed`, event types `session.reversed` and `withdrawal.reversed`, and error code `PAYMENT_REVERSED`. Code that switches on these unions must handle the new members. The modal shows "Payment reversed" (in every built-in language), and the admin page has a filter, a stats card and a detail row for reversed sessions.

- 5c5019e: `Step.sub` is now a closed list of lowercase values: `StepSub`, with `STEP_SUBS` and `isStepSub` in `@openrampkit/core`. Before, it mixed case and raw provider strings (`CONFIRMING`, `confirming`, Relay and LI.FI statuses), and the web UI title-cased them. Adapters now map provider statuses to the list (for example LI.FI `WAIT_DESTINATION_TRANSACTION` is `bridging`, Relay `waiting` is `waiting_for_deposit`) and put the raw value in the new `LegStep.providerStatus`. The server writes it to the timeline (`leg.provider_status`), never to the browser, and drops a `sub` that is not in the list. The web element shows `messages.stepSub[sub]`, translated in every catalog (en, vi, id, th, ms, fil).

### Patch Changes

- 25b1f98: Coinbase: a new `coinbase_account` leg lets the user pay from the fiat or crypto balance of a Coinbase account (`FIAT_WALLET` or `CRYPTO_WALLET`, option `accountBalance`). A new `guest_apple_pay` leg (option `guestCheckout`) gives guest Apple Pay in the US with the Headless Onramp API: an order quote, a payment link in an `IFRAME`, order status and order webhooks. Core: new method code `coinbase_account` (kind `exchange`) and an optional `referrerPolicy` on the `IFRAME` surface. Web: the provider frame uses that referrer policy.
- b614b50: The done screen says the amount was deposited when the destination ran contract calls (for example a vault deposit). The "Checking status" line hides while an error shows.
- 6e7899b: Onramper: a `401` or `403` (for example `errorId 4011` "No V2 signing key is registered for this API key") is now a setup error: `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` with `retryable: false` and recovery `choose_other`. The user sees a neutral message, and the operator gets an error log that says what to do (register the Ed25519 public key, check the signature, the API key or the IP allowlist). An onramp quote with no fee fields (for example guardarian) now gets a fee line "included in rate": for USD to a USD stablecoin it is the input minus the payout, else the amount is `0` with the new `Fee.inRate` flag. The web quote row does not show "No fees" for such a quote, and the MCP quote view says "amount not given".
- c24a0f7: Security hardening: body size limits (413), input checks on sessions and browser routes, idempotency keys scoped per route, session deadline enforced on quote, select and restart, surface URL checks (no `javascript:` or `data:` URLs) on the server, client and web component, a single treasury send under concurrent requests, a block time check for Relay same-chain payments, minimum lengths for `webhooks.secret` and `tasksToken`, empty webhook keys refused by Stripe and Swapped, and the mock adapter refuses live sessions. New in core: `isWebUrl` and `isSafeLinkUrl`.
- 718dfbb: Accessibility: WCAG AA text contrast in the light and dark palettes (muted text, success color), text on soft accent backgrounds uses the text color, and a custom accent becomes the focus ring only with 3:1 contrast. The dialog sets `lang`, keeps Tab inside itself (also where the browser skips buttons), handles Escape and Tab when focus is outside it, and returns focus to an opener that is still disabled at close. Results and "Copied" are announced in status regions. The amount field is marked invalid over the balance, with a text message tied to it. Form fields point at the step error. Touch targets are at least 44 px on phones, selects keep their size in WebKit, method subtitles wrap instead of being cut off, and a redirect without an SDK renderer is a real link. New strings: `overBalance`, `opensInNewTab`. New helper: `contrastRatio`.
